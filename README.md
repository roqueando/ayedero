# Ayedero - Simplicity in my configs


## Neovim

- For this editor is all simple, just some keybindings
	- The `<leader>` key is `;`
	- `[j-k]` for escaping
	- `[<leader>w]` for saving files
	- `[<leader>f]` for finding files
	- `[<leader>e]` for opening `netrw`
	- `[<leader>t]` {Working in Progress...}


## Tmux

- For this tmux config is a couple things
	- The `<prefix>` is `[Ctrl-b]`
	- `[<prefix>\]` to split vertical
	- `[<prefix>-]` to split horizontal
	- `[Ctrl-h]` to move to the <- left pane
	- `[Ctrl-j]` to move to the V down pane
	- `[Ctrl-k]` to move to the ^ up pane
	- `[Ctrl-l]` to move to the -> right pane
